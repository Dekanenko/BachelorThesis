# Layer architecture with embedded adaptive activation functions based on neural subnetworks

### Two layers were created that provide neurons with their own adaptive activation functions. These functions are based on neural subnetworks: the first architecture uses MLP for the subnetwork, whereas the second one – 1D-Convolutions. It allows to create different type of activation functions for the neurons which would adapt themselves to a dataset given.
